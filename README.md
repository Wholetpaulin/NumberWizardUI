# NumberWizardUI
This is a number guessing game I created following the second lesson of the Udemy course: Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer

### Instructions

1. Click on the designated link:   https://wholetpaulin.github.io/NumberWizardUI/   (Wait for game to load up)

2. Think of a number in your head between 1 and 1000.

3. Guide the computer with the higher or lower buttons to see if it can guess the number you thought of. (Can also use arrow keys)
